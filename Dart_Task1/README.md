## Task Objectives
The main objectives of this task are:

- To understand basic Dart programming concepts  
- To practice writing beginner-friendly Dart programs  
- To organize Dart code using a proper folder structure  
- To learn how to manage and upload projects using Git and GitHub  

---

## Learning Outcomes
Through this task, I learned:

- Core Dart concepts such as variables, data types, operators, control flow, and functions  
- How Dart handles null safety, nullable and non-nullable variables  
- How to use anonymous functions and arrow functions  
- How to work with Dart collections like lists, sets, and maps  
- The importance of clean code organization and documentation  
- How to push and manage code using Git and GitHub

## Project Folder Structure
The project is organized into multiple folders based on concepts:

### 01_basics/
- `hello_world.dart` – Prints Hello World  
- `variables.dart` – Demonstrates variable declaration  
- `data_types.dart` – Explains Dart data types  
- `type_inference.dart` – Shows type inference in Dart  
- `operators.dart` – Covers basic operators  

#### control_flow/
- `if_else.dart` – Conditional statements  
- `switch_case.dart` – Switch case usage  
- `loops.dart` – For, while, and do-while loops  

---

### 02_functions/
- `basic_functions.dart` – Simple function examples  
- `parameters.dart` – Function parameters  
- `return_types.dart` – Return values from functions  
- `arrow_functions.dart` – Arrow function syntax  
- `anonymous_functions.dart` – Anonymous and callback functions  

---

### 03_collections/
- `lists.dart` – List operations  
- `sets.dart` – Set usage  
- `maps.dart` – Map key-value pairs  
- `collection_methods.dart` – Common collection methods  

---

### 04_null_safety/
- `nullable_vs_non_nullable.dart` – Nullable vs non-nullable variables  
- `late_keyword.dart` – Usage of `late` keyword  
- `null_aware_operators.dart` – `??`, `?.`, and `!` operators  

---

## How to Run the Dart Programs
Follow the steps below to run the Dart files:

1. Open the terminal or command prompt  
2. Navigate to the project folder  
3. Run the required Dart file using the command:

```bash
dart run filename.dart
```
---

### Example
```bash
dart run variable.dart
```
