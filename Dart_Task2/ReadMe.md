# Dart Task 2 – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Dart

## Overview
This task focuses on understanding and implementing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts using the **Dart programming language**. It is designed to strengthen conceptual knowledge and practical implementation of OOP principles through well-structured examples and real-world–style tasks.

This repository contains basic and advanced OOP concepts, along with hands-on practice programs to improve code reusability, scalability, and maintainability.

---

## Task Objectives
The main objectives of this task are:

- To understand core **Object-Oriented Programming concepts**
- To implement OOP principles using **Dart**
- To differentiate between basic and advanced OOP features
- To write clean, modular, and reusable code
- To improve problem-solving skills using real-world examples

---

## Learning Outcomes
Through this task, I learned:

- Creating and using **classes and objects** in Dart
- Implementing **inheritance** for code reusability
- Understanding and applying **encapsulation**
- Using **abstraction** to hide implementation details
- Implementing **interfaces** in Dart
- Applying **polymorphism** for dynamic behavior
- Structuring medium-sized Dart programs using OOP concepts

## Dart Programs Included

### Basic OOP Concepts
- Class and object creation
- Inheritance implementation
- Real-world task-based OOP examples
- Smart Campus Terminal system

### Advanced OOP Concepts
- **Encapsulation** using getters and setters
- **Abstraction** using abstract classes
- **Polymorphism** through method overriding
- **Interfaces** implementation

### Mini Project
- **Food Delivery System**

## How to Run the Programs

Follow these steps to run any Dart file:

1. Open terminal or command prompt  
2. Navigate to the `Dart_Task2` folder  
3. Run the Dart file using the command:

```bash
dart filename.dart
```
dart fooddelivery.dart

## Conclusion
Completing this task significantly improved my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming in Dart. 
It helped me learn how to design structured programs, apply OOP principles in real-world scenarios, 
and write maintainable and scalable code. This task also prepared me for building larger applications 
using Flutter and Dart.
